# HotSwap

HotSwap is COMGR's AMDGPU code-object rewriting support. The public
`amd_comgr_hotswap_rewrite` API takes an executable code object plus source and
target ISA names, then returns a new executable code object with the applicable
rewrite applied. The input code object is not modified.

This directory contains COMGR's hotswap transpiler scaffolding, the raiser-based
path for heavier cross-ISA transformations. The same-family stepping patches and
optional entry trampolines are implemented in the surrounding COMGR source files
and are exposed through `amd_comgr_hotswap_rewrite`.

## Supported transformations

| Transformation | Status |
| -------------- | ------ |
| gfx1250 B0 to A0 | Supported |
| gfx1250 entry trampolines | Supported, opt-in |
| gfx950 | Coming soon |
| gfx942 | Coming soon |

## Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
| -------- | ------ |
| `AMD_COMGR_HOTSWAP_ENTRY_TRAMPOLINES` | Set to a nonzero value to redirect gfx1250 kernel descriptor entries through COMGR-generated entry stubs, independent of A0/B0 stepping. Off by default. |

## Transpiler (cross-gen)

The transpiler is the heavier sibling to the byte-level rewrite. It raises
AMDGPU code objects into LLVM IR, re-lowers them through the stock AMDGPU backend
for a different target ISA, and relinks the result into a single merged HSACO.
The rewrite path applies in-place stepping patches; the transpiler instead hands
the whole code object to the IR pipeline. It can be built standalone for
development:

```bash
cmake -S amd/comgr/hotswap -B build-hotswap \
  -DLLVM_DIR=$PWD/build/lib/cmake/llvm
ninja -C build-hotswap
ctest --test-dir build-hotswap -L transpiler
```
